Besides being a Computer Science student I write Poems and post them regularly on my [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/inklinks_of_my_heart/){:target="_blank"} as well as [here](https://inklinks.me/){:target="_blank"}.

I am a final year M.Tech. student in Computer Science Department @[IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India](https://iiitd.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. I received his B.Tech. degree from [Indian Institute of Information Technology Vadadara, Gandhinagar Campus, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India](http://iiitvadodara.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}.

I love to write and read Poems. I also love to code stuffs and Machine Learning. You can always find me here or somewhere lost in my thoughts trying to go deep into **nearly**-impossible-to-solve mysteries of this universe.
