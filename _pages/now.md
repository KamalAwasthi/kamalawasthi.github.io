## What have I been upto lately?

### Joined Oracle India ðŸ˜‡

* It has been \~10 months now since I joined Oracle.
* but still working in WFH mode :sad: 
* excited to meet teammates soon and visit the office in Bengaluru.

### I finished a book, "The White Tiger"

* Full of sarcastic humour and witty writing, loved the writing style of the author.
* A must-read for everyone who wants to or already is familiar with society and its culture in India. Book also shows basic human nature and a journey of a poor man in India.
* Absolutely loved it!
