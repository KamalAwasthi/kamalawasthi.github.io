## What have I been up to lately?

###### updated: 26 July 2022

### Finished \~1 year at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/in/index.html "Oracle") ðŸ˜‡

* Time flies, really!! Feels like yesterday when I joined Oracle as a rookie.
* Well, I am still learning, my goal is far ahead but I am moving towards it day by day.
* This one year marks a huge if not the most important milestone in my life and career. It has been a great journey so far.

* A truly madly inspiring book by a true Hindu monk. What an inspiration!
* His teachings are still valid after more than 100 years.
* Exploring a new perspective of seeing the society around me every day.
* What a man Swami Ji!
